An interviewer wants to see that you are going through this process, and have these tools at your disposal, even if you do not need to lean on them for a particular problem.  \n",

We also give the interviewer an opportunity to direct him in certain areas.  If the interviewer wants us to skip over this phase and get straight to solving the problem, the interviewer will point us in that direction.\n",
