    "\n",
    "When we initialize a list in a programming language, the language allocates space in memory an initial list, and then points that variable's starting point in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In initializing the list, the program assigns a fixed amount of memory for each element.  \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, let's say my list say begins at memory address 100.  And that Python allocates 8 bits of space for each element in the list -- and enough space for ten elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so given the above, let's think about how a computer can retrieve an element of a list at a specific index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "letters = ['a']\n",
    "\n",
    "letters[0]\n",
    "# a\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So above, we first initialize the array and assign the letter 'a' as the first element, the programming language associates the letter \"a\" to a specific location in memory.  In our example, address 100.  So then, when we call `my_arr[0]` all the program has to do is go to address 100, and retreive the element."

Retrieving elements by index and adding elements to the end of the array has a time complexity of big O(1), while adding or removing elements at the beginning of a list is big O(n).  We also saw that because operations in our array rely on using neighboring locations in memory, we can run out of space.\n",
